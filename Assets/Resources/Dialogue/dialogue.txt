Ever since the pandemic, I've been finding it harder to go outside. 
After all, it was mandated, so I just... didn't. 
Even after the mandates lifted, I was too busy playing video games to go outside. 
"I'm just being safe," I thought. But weeks turned into months, and eventually I discovered a year had passed. 
But it didn't matter to me. 
Until my friend messaged me recently. 
"I've set up a speed dating competition for you," she said. 
"<i>Please</i> get outside," the message continued. "You need to talk to real men and women."
It didn't really matter my opinion on the matter, though, because she showed up to my door later that evening anyway.
"I don't need to talk to anyone," I had pleaded, but she looked at me with disappointed eyes anyway. 
"You log an average of 12 hours on League of Legends every day. You're <i>going.</i>"
And so...
<speaker="Stella" sprite="happy">
"Hey, are you the person I'm supposed to meet?"
<sprite="flushed1">
This is that 'speed dating' thingy I saw online, yeah?
I'm surprised someone would have the guts to make an ad like that. Aren't you afraid of creeps?
<i>Just what did my friend post?!</i>
<choice>
	<Choice1> Uhhh....
	<Choice2> Yeah...

<i>Crap. She's way out of my league.</i>

Well, I can't fault you for being nervous...
So... what hobbies do you have?
<choice>
	<Choice5>Well, I play a lot of League...
	<Choice6>So there's this anime...
</choice>
<label="Choice5">
<event="LoveMeter" arg="+3">
Her eyes shine. 
<speaker="Stella" sprite="flushed2">
You play League too!?
Wow, I never thought I'd meet someone who'd admit to playing that game!
I'm really bad at it, though. I'm only silver. 
Even my friends make fun of me for it, haha. 
<choice>
	<Choice7> That's why I don't have friends. 
	<Choice8> I can totally carry you.

<event="LoveMeter" arg="-3">
Ooh... sorry about that.
<event="LoadScene" arg="MainMenu">

<label="Choice8">
<speaker="Stella" sprite="happy">
You can? 
Hm... but you don't look very strong. 
I guess you can try? 
<i>It doesn't seem as if she knows that term...</i>
<choice>
	<Choice9> Yeah, I can lift you.
	<Choice10> No, like, the gamer term.
</choice>
<label="Choice9">
<speaker="Stella" sprite="mad">
<event="LoveMeter" arg="-3">
You foolishly try to lift her, and you drop her almost immediately. 
<speaker="You"> 
Whoops. 
<event="LoadScene" arg="MainMenu">
<end>
<label="Choice10">
<speaker="You"> 
You explain the term to her. 
<speaker="Stella" sprite="happy">
Oh, so that's what that means? 
Well, you learn something new everyday! 
I wouldn't be opposed to playing a game with you, you know. 
<speaker="Stella" sprite="flushed1">
I don't really show that part of myself to many people, so I'm happy we have that in common.
Haha, maybe we can make it a date? 
<speaker="You">
<i>How did I pull that off?!</i>

Before you're even aware of it, your mouth begins to move on its own. 
So there's this guy named Monkey D. Luffy, and essentially, he's trying to find this thing called the One Piece. 
But like, no one knows what the One Piece is, but apparetly it's super powerful. Oh, they're also pirates-- I say they because there's a whole ragtag
group of peeople he meets along the way like Nami and Zoro and Robin, and...
<speaker="Stella" sprite="happy">
I guess that sounds interesti--
<speaker="You">
Oh, and they're all pirates, so they travel the open seas to seach for this treasure, like pirates do, yeah? 
And they have these superpowers called Devil Fruit, and...
...
<speaker="Stella" sprite="mad">
... 
You realize you've been talking for twenty minutes now.
Oops.
